<title>Aether - kd8lvt</title>
<h2>Hey! I see you've joined my server and are looking for the rules and guide! Well, here they are! Take a look!</h2>
<h1>RULES</h1>
1. Please don't mess with the aether build! AKA: Don't break any blocks. If I'm forced to put every one in adventure mode, I will.
2. Do not grief ANYWHERE. Its rude, disrespectful, and irritating... Don't do it.
3. Feel free to raid dungeons in the Aether with friends, or alone, just don't break the spawners - thanks!
4. DO NOT MAKE YOUR OWN AETHER PORTAL! There is one at spawn - use it!
<h1>GUIDE</h1>
1. To get the Aether's book, just throw a gold ingot, and a book, on the ground!
2. The Aether resources (Old Bones and Aether Crystals) can be found by killing the Aether mobs.
3. Anything Aether-related can be crafted by throwing a dispenser named "Advanced Crafting Table" on the ground, then crafting it there. There are plenty littered around spawn ;)
4. Everything else it detailed in the Aether book - have fun!
5. OH! And don't enter the Aether unarmed or unarmored. Thats a bad idea. Fully enchanted armor AND weapons are highly advised. So is feather falling!
