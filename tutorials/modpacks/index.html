        <br />
        <p>So you want to play on one of BASCraft's modded servers? Well, here's a guide on how to download any modpack I'll ever put on there!</p>
        <br />
        <h2>STEP 1: Download the Twitch client</h2>
        <br />
        <p>While this is a simple process, some people find it difficult, so I'll go through it step by step.</p>
        <p>1. Download Twitch from this website: </p><a href="http://app.twitch.tv/">app.twitch.tv</a>
        <p>2. Run the Installer you just downloaded. Don't worry about any viruses or anything from this tutorial, by the way. I'm not that kind of person.</p>
        <p>3. After Twitch has installed, you'll want to get a Twitch.tv account, if you don't have one already. Just click this link: </p><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a>
        <p>4. Once you have a Twitch account, log into the Twitch app, and Click the creeper face in the lower left.</p>
        <p>5. Click "Install" and wait a bit for it to download everything it needs. That screen just means it doesn't have the stuff required to play Minecraft through Twitch.</p>
        <p>6. Once it's done, Click "Browse all Modpacks"</p>
        <p>7. Click on the search bar, and type in the name of the modpack you wish to play. It can be all, part of, or even the wrong capitalization, Twitch will still know what you're talking about.</p>
        <p>8. Now that you've found the modpack you wish to play - for example, Project Ozone 2, hover over the pack's image and click "Install". If you already have the pack installed (which you shouldn't) it will just say Play.</p>
        <p>9. Wait for the pack to install. Sometimes this can take upwards of an hour, depending on pack size, computer speed, and internet speed.</p>
        <p>10. Once the pack is ready, the bar will go away over the pack's description. At this point you can click on the creeper face again and see that you now have your pack installed! Hover over it the same way you installed it (in the main menu), but this time click "Play"!,</p>
        <p>11. At this point Twitch is readying the Minecraft launcher to launch your pack. Sometimes it can take a bit the first time you launch a pack, so just sit tight! Once the Minecraft launcher appears, all you have to do is click Play! (again!)</p>
        <p>12. Some packs can take FOREVER to load. Trust me, I know. The packs that we play on BASCraft can be particuarly large, so depending on how good your computer is, it might not even load. (See the FAQ for help increasing memory allocation!)</p>

        <p>You've got the pack downloaded and fired up, but you still aren't sure how to get on the server? No problem, it's as simple as pie!</p>
        <h3>STEP 1: Locate the "Multiplayer" button, and click it.</h3>
        <h4>While this seems trivial, some packs modify the layout of the main menu. Normally it will be labeled something similar to "Multiplayer" but others completely change it to something pack-specific. For example, The Ferret Buisiness labels theirs "Works well with others".</p>
        <h4>Here are some ideas of where to look if it's giving you trouble:
        <h6>1. Look just under the singleplayer button</h6>
        <p>This is where they are, if not right next to the singleplayer button, normally.</p>
        <h6>2. Hover over everything!</h6>
        <p>While this seems weird, using the earlier example of The Ferret Buisiness, when you hover over the buttons it tells you what they are.</p>
        <h6>3. Think real about the names, and what they could mean.</h6>
        <p>Going back to The Ferret Buisiness, "Works well with others" is a fairly obvious one. The Dark Age's multiplayer button says "Die with Friends"... It's a fairly evil pack, but is a good example of this.</p>
        <h6>4. Think of the theme of the name, and how it relates to the theme of the pack</h6>
        <p>The Ferret Buisiness' theme is very company-like, and the main menu looks like an application.</p>
        <h3>STEP 2: Add BASCraft to your server menu.</h3>
        <p>1. Click "Add Server"</p>
        <p>2. Replace "Minecraft Server" with whatever name you like, for example, BASCraft</p>
        <p>3. Put the IP of the pack you want to join below. What do I mean by that? You'll figure it out when you see the server list.</p>
        <p>4. Click "Done"</p>
        <p>5. That's it! Select BASCraft and click "Join"! If you have issues connecting, feel free to contact me (kd8lvt) through Twitch, by adding me as a friend. (SEE FAQ)</p>

        <h3> Help! I can't join the server! It says "Timed Out"!</h3>
        <p>Just try joining a few more times. If that doesn't work, add me as a friend on Twitch and I'll try and help you.</p>
        <h3> Help! I can't join the server! It just says "Disconnected"!?</h3>
        <p>That's a bit harder to fix just through text, as that can mean any number of things. add me as a friend on Twitch and ask me about it, I'll see what I can do.</p>
        <h3> Help! I can't join the server! It says "Mod Rejections: " then a whole bunch of names!</h3>
        <p>You have the wrong version of the pack, or even the wrong pack for the server you are trying to join. Make sure you have the right version/ip!</p>
        <h3> Help! My game keeps crashing before it loads! OR: Help! My game keeps crashing as I log in!</h3>
        <p>This can mean a lot of things, from Minecraft running out of memory, to the pack being faulty. I can help you with giving it more memory (SEE: How do I allocate more RAM?), but it's hard after that to pinpoint things without a log.</p>
        <h3> How do I allocate more RAM? </h3>
        <p>Here's a quick Step-By-Step tutorial on increasing memory allocation with Twitch:</p>
        <p>1. Go to the Twitch app</p>
        <p>2. Click the cog/gear/settings wheel in the lower left</p>
        <p>3. Click the creeper face on the left</p>
        <p>4. Scroll down until you see "Advanced Java Settings" Click that, and put in the text box (without quotes): "-Xmx4G" JUST LIKE THAT</p>
        <p>5. Click "Done" and that's it!</p>
        <p>(NOTE: Some button names or labels might be a bit off, but they're close enough to the original thing that it'll be easy to figure it out.)</p>
        <h3>How do I add you as a friend on Twitch?</h3>
        <p>It's super simple! Just click the Message Bubbles on the top left (above the creeper face from before) then type in my name (kd8lvt) in the search box. Click "Search People" (or something like that) and click any of the profiles you see. Those are just the different games I have linked.</p>
