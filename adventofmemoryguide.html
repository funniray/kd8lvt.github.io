<h1>THIS GUIDE IS VERY WIP! TAKE EVERYTHING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT!</h1>
<h4>Sorry about there being no pictures, go to the AoA wiki for that!</h4>
<h4>NEI is your best friend! If there is no recipe, its a 90% chance a mob will drop it!</h4>
<h3>OPTIONAL SETUP!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make your world with Cheats enabled! This is useful not only for if a bug heppens (ex. recipe conflict), but all the below stuff in this section needs it!</li>
    <li>Already made your world without reading the above? No problem! Open your world to LAN, and enable Cheats that way!</li>
    <li>Keep Your Inventory: Enabling KeepInventory is highly suggested, even by the mod author. However, it is a little different in this modpack, or any modpack with AoA installed!</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Make sure cheats are enabled! Don't say there is a bug with this part of the guide if they aren't!</li>
        <li>2. Type in chat: /gamerule keepAllInventory true</li>
        <li>3. Make sure you got the response, "Gamerule Updated!" or something simmilar.</li>
        <li>4. Feel free to die, you won't lose your inventory, or XP.
      </ul>
    <li>Death Counter: Playing Multiplayer with some friends, or just want to keep track of how many times you die? Its rather simple, just follow these instructions!</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Make sure cheats are enabled! Don't say there is a bug in this part of the guide if they aren't!</li>
        <li>2. Type in chat: /scoreboard objectives add deaths deathCount Deaths
        <li>3. Type in chat: /scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar deaths
        <li>4. Die, and it should appear on the right of your screen!
      </ul>
    <li>Stop Creepers from breaking blocks: They still hurt though.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Make sure cheats are enabled! Don't say there is a bug in this part of the guide if they aren't!</li>
        <li>2. Type in chat: /gamerule mobGriefing false</li>
        <li>3. Now Creepers (and other mobs) won't break blocks! As well as that, Endermen won't pick up blocks.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
<h3>BEGINNING</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you spawn inside or near a forest. If you spawn in a Savannah, remake the world. Svannahs have mobs that you literally cannot hit. At all.</li>
    <li>Punch wood, and get a lot before night falls! This is even more important in Advent of Memory, because of all the new, dangerous mobs.</li>
    <li>Do NOT make a wooden sword, unless you are absolutely deperate. I.E. a 250 health mob is chasing you. Make a stone, or better yet, iron one.</li>
    <li>Get iron armor as fast as possible. If you can kill a few Mother Voidwalkers and gest some Void armor, wear that instead.</li>
    <li>Try to get diamonds as soon as possible. You need a diamond pickaxe to even attempt to mine the AoA ores.</li>
    <li>Caves are your best bet to getting better gear, as they contain both Mother Voidwalkers, and are the easiest way to find AoA ores.</li>
    <li>Upgrade to a Rosite, Void, or Sapphire sword as soon as possible. They are the easiest higher-damage swords to get.</li>
    <li>Get 8 Amethyst Ingots and a Diamond to make an Ancient Teleporter Blueprint, and try to find some Realmstones.</li>
    <li>The Nether isn't really nessesary, unless you have a couple Pets that eat Nether Quartz, so don't go there, unless absolutely nessesary.</li>
    <li>Have fun, and explore the modpack!</li>
