<h3>Twitter Profile Picture</h3>
<p>All week (from 11/14/15 to 11/21/15) I will have the French flag in the lower right hand of my profile picture on twitter, in homage to those who died in the attack earlier this week.</p>
<p>To those who had family die in the attack, I am truly sorry for your loss, and you are in my thoughts. I hope that sometime soon, when you think of them, a smile comes to your face before a tear comes from your eye.</p>
<p>This is a really short post, as it was meant to fit in a tweet, but it didn't. So, its just normal HTML. No fancy CSS or javascript this time, so really, so far this is the only page that is straight up HTML, and honestly, will probably be the only one.</p>
