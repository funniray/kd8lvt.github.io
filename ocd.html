      <h1>OCD</h1>
      <h3>An extremely opinionated post!</h3>
      <div id="bannerImage"></div>
      <p>I'm being completely honest - this is ALL html. I kid you not - look at the source. The only thing that ISN'T HTML is the downloader for this font that I love so much, (Thanks Adobe!) as well as the formatting, I tried but couldn't get it to look this good without CSS.</p>
      <p>Anyways, welcome to the post where I ramble on about people saying that they are OCD (looking at you 90% of the Minecraft players out there) but don't even know what it means. To make this easier, I will both A. Explain OCD in my own words, then B. give you a video that explains it WAY better than I ever could, all in basic HTML, as is the site standard Okay, fine... theres a bit of CSS involved too >.></p>
      <p>When you think OCD you probably think "Everything goes in its own spot, and it has to be symmetrical." Not quite. OCD causes severe anxiety in those affected and involves both obsessions and compulsions that interfere with normal, everyday life. When diagnosing OCD, there is no magical brain scanner that tells you immediately "Hey! You have OCD!" Instead, diagnosises are generally made by a metal health professional, and are based off of obsrvations of daily behavior.</p>
      <p>The two main factors in OCD are Obsessions, and Compulsions. Obsessions are persistent ideas, they don't really force you to do anything. Symmetry and organization could easily fit into this category, though obsessions don't force you to do something, as its commonly "understood".</p>
      <p>Compulsions are the individual's attempts to stop the obsessions through performing it, sometimes repeatedly, and sometimes even an exact amount of times. For example, say somebody has the obsession of walking to their front door. Depending on the strength of that obsession, they may need to walk to their door fifteen times in a certain hour, and three times in the next, and five in the next, or they may only have to do it once, but take exactally fifty-three steps to get there, or they would have to do it over again. Obviously, that could interfere with daily life.</p>
      <p>So, next time you see your neighbor walk their dog every hour, and think "Oh, that guy is OCD" stop for a second and REALLY think about it - maybe the dog just needs the exersize, or maybe the guy does, or maybe the dog just really has to use the bathroom! Anyways, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX7jnVXXG5o">here</a> is your video, I didn't forget. That video also goes over other anxiety disorders, I really recommend watching it, its a good one.</p>
