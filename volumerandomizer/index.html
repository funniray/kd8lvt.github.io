    <h1>Volume Randomizer</h1>
    <p>Sorry that this page is so bare-bones at the moment, I'm working on getting a replacement.</p>
    <p>For now, welcome to the page for Volume Randomizer!</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <br />
    <p>Volume Randomizer is a program for people with over-sensitive hearing,</p>
    <p>making a way for people to train their brain to be less sensitive to auditory input,</p>
    <p>without having to listen to classical music.</p>
    <p>All you have to do is run Volume Randomizer in the background, and continue using your computer as normal.</p>
    <p>Volume Randomizer does all the work for you, modifying your volume every few seconds. </p>
    <p><bold>All you have to do is listen to any music, watch videos, or even just play games!</bold></p> 
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Volume Randomizer does what it says on the tin; it randomizes your computer's volume, within a safe range.</p>

    <p>In a nutshell, Volume Randomizer uses NodeJS and a few modules for it to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get a somewhat random value, using Simplex Noise</li>
      <li>Modify it using a "Volume Biome"</li>
      <li>Make sure it's within a comfortable range for human hearing (between 20% and 70%)</li>
      <li>Set your volume gradually</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Why make Volume Randomizer?</h2>
    <p>I made Volume Randomizer in the hopes of creating a safe, cheap, and fun way to help people like myself with sensitive hearing.</p>
    <p>As a person who has suffered from incredibly sensitive hearing, and not being able to go to events with a lot of people because of it,</p>
    <p>I decided to make Volume Randomizer, and then release it for others to use.</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Is it safe?</h2>
    <p>Of course! Volume Randomizer is designed with the saftey of it's users in mind. It makes sure your volume is kept within a safe range.</p>
    <p>And no need to worry about viruses or anything; I'm not that kind of person.</p>
    <p>However, if your antivirus does think Volume Randomizer is a virus, it's because of the nature of volume control; I can't do much about it.</p>
