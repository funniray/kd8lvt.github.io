<h2>PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS A RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF RAM YOU SHOULD HAVE ON YOUR COMPUTER AT MINIMUM. THIS NUMBER IS SIX GIGABYTES.</h2>
<p>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST SIX GIGABYTES OF RAM FIRST! Here's how:</p> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=How+do+I+check+how+much+RAM+my+computer+has%3F">How much ram do I have?</a>
<ol>
<li>Start by installing Curse Voice, if you haven't already. I'm assuming you already have Minecraft installed. If not, install that first.</li>
<li>Launch Curse Voice (What, you expected me to make you install something but not launch it right away?)</li>
<li>Log in with a Curse account. If you have a Minecraft Forums acount already, use that. Otherwise, create a new one.</li>
<li>Next, click on the creeper face on the left-hand bar. It should be all the way at the bottom.</li>
<li>Near the top you should see a "Browse All Modpacks" button. Click that and type in the search bar (it should be on the left if you can't find it) "All The Mods Expert"</li>
<li>Find All the Mods Expert in the list (it should be the only one, in theory)</li>
<li>Click the image. DO NOT CLICK INSTALL! That will install the latest version, which the server is not updated to.</li>
<li>Click where it says "Versions"</li>
<li>Click the download button in the list that has "allthemods Expert v1.0.21" in the middle of it's row. The download buttons are all on the right hand side.</li> 
<li>Wait a while. Depending on your internet speed this can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Be patient!</li>
<li>Once ATMExpert has finished downloading, click the settings wheel on the left-hand side of the window we've been using all the way at the bottom. (That's Curse.)</li>
<li>Click the Creeper face again, this time in the settings window though. It's the third one from the bottom on mine.</li>
<li>Scroll down until you either see "Advanced Settings" or "Launcher Settings"</li>
<li>If you see "Advanced Settings", click it. If you see "Launcher Settings", go to the next step.</li>
<li>Scroll down until you see "JAVA SETTINGS" and then "MAXIMUM MEMORY ALLOCATION" Slide the bar up until it says "4,096" above it.</li>
<li>Save the settings, and then go back to the Minecraft menu.</li>
<li>Launch All The Mods Expert by hovering over the profile with your mouse, and clicking "Play"</li>
<li>Wait for it to launch. Depending on your computer, this can take anywhere from a few minutes, to an hour. For example, I have a pretty bad computer, so it takes about a half-hour. My brother has a great computer, so it takes him about fifteem minutes.</li>
<li>Once it has launched put the normal BASCraft ip in. If you do not know it, and can prove you go to Belding Schools, friend me on Curse (kd8lvt) and I can give you the IP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You can now join the server, and play! If you need help with it (which you will, trust me.) Craft one dirt by itself to get a book that will teach you the basics (don't ask, I have no idea how it works either.)</p>
